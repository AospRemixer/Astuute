# Math

You will be given 10 logical questions. Your goal is to figure out the correct awnser for each of them. More correct awnser may mean higher level of Mathematical intelligence. The logical-mathematical learning style is one of eight types of learning styles, or intelligences, defined in developmental psychologist Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences. 

# Memory

You will see random numbers between 1-100, you will have to click next, if you see a number that repeated TWICE. Then you can click repeated, once you do everything will clear up and you will have to spot a new pair of repeated numbers! The goal is to catch as many repeated numbers as you can. A study by University of Chicago researchers has proven that memory games do improve memory. Good Luck!

# Reasoning

You will be encounter intelligence quesions releated to reasoning. If you can awnser 10 questions, then you win. Science has backed up that this practise of exposing yourself to these types of questions may improve your reasoning and IQ. Doing this daily will helo you problem solve. 

# Creativity 

In spatial exercise, you can draw whatever you want, Unleash your creativity. Creativity is surprisingly a very important part of intelligence. If a child can figure out different ways of doing a task, then he is smart.  This exercise is extremely effective on kids, scientists have found that early education plays a large role in preparing our children for later success in spatial learningâ€‹â€‹ because spatial reasoning starts early in the child development process. Neuroscientists find that specific regions in the brain responsible for thinking about location and spatial relations develop in very early childhoodâ€‹â€‹. Preschoolers' spatial abilities can predict their future performance in math learning in middle and high schoolâ€‹â€‹.

# Vocab

In the vocab exercise, you will see a 3d model of a random object. You will be given a few words that describe the object, the twist is that you have to figure out which one of them applies the best to the 3d object. If you figure out the correct one, then that's a point for you. More points mean a higher score. This exercise will increase your vocab since you will learn a new word every time you get a question wrong. Good Luck!<br/>
_**Warning: 3d Models might be laggy and slow on some computers! If that app looks like its frozen, give it some time. It needs to load the 3d model!**_

# Awareness

Welcome to awarness training, here you will see a tap speed tester. You have to try to click as fast as possible. The faster you click, The faster your brain can send commands to your body. All you want to do is just practice your tap speed, this will help improve your kinesthetic intelligence. The result isn't instant, it requires practice. Take breaks and continue practicing. Good Luck!

# Have a great time! Good Luck!
