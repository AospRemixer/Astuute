ðŸ‘‘ The developer of Astuute ðŸ‘‘
===========

Hello I am Prabhdeep Singh, a 14 year kid who loved programming. I always loved to make things, but I most of the time I didn't have supplies. 
So I started making things with what I had. Eventually this became a habit. Once I wasn't able to download my favorite game on my old tablet. 
I looked into it, and found out that this is because the Android Version was quite outdated, and then that is when I made it my goal to learn programming 
and make my own version of [AOSP](https://source.android.com/). I couldn't do that right away, so I had to start somewhere. I started off by learning python.
I knew python is a great choice because python is increasing in popularity and it is also very easy to learn. After I got used to python, I figured that I couldn't
**MAKE** the type of things that I like with python. So I started looking for a different coding language. One day... I came across **C#**. I learnt that I can make Unity games with it. 
I really wanted to do that, so I started learning c#. At the back of my head, I knew that I actually wanted to learn how to make windows apps! I used to think that you needed to know C++ to make windows apps.
One day I searched up what coding langauge is used to make windows apps, and google said that 90% of windows apps are made with C#!! I couldn't be happier. That was the best news for me!
I started learning how to make WPF apps, and started getting used to visual studio. I made my [first app](https://github.com/AospRemixer/SimpleTimerApp_Basic) with WPF which was a stopwatch app. 3 days after that, I got a ping on discord. 
The notification was about how timathon started, I instantly got interesed and decided to join. **[This was literally 3 days after I made my first wpf app!]** I worked super hard, and put all my effort into this app so I could win this. 
I had a big learning curve to go through, but I wasn't gonna stop. I knew I had to win this code jam. _And I ended up making Asuute :D_ All I need after this is a big sleep!
